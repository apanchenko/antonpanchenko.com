My personal photo blog (react training sandbox) powered by Gatsby.

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`

## Build production in public folder
`gatsby build`

## TODO
- get styles from previous version
- normalize image size
- update readme
- make footer with contacts
- style post dates. Probably in posts only, after title
- comments
- menu?
