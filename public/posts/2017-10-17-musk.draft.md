When something randomly appears at least twice a day in my sight - probably it is not that random. Mr. Elon Musk came to me twice today )

First time - a young woman was deciding is Elon better spouse than prince Charles. This is crazy female mind, how twisted routes it goes!

Second time I cought a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojy3CRdZNyQ) where Elon states that a young person does not need even a college degree.
With that I agree. What we need is a desire and skills of learning and creating things. And this is inseparably related to the increasing specialization.
