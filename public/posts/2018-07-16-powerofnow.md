# Several quotes from the book:

* The ego needs problems, conflict, and enemies to strengthen the sense of separateness on which its identity depends.
* Identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, is ultimately a fiction of the mind.

* You cannot transform yourself, and you certainly cannot transform your partner or anybody else. All you can do is create a space for transformation to happen, for grace and love to enter. It is the most precious gift you can give.

* Every addiction starts with pain and ends with pain.

* If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing.

* Suffering needs time. You cannot be free in the future. Presence is the key to freedom, so you can only be free now.
* Time isnâ€™t precious at all, because it is an illusion.

* Do you want an easy death?
