I used [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator to make this site. Gatsby is cool and was a huge jump for me. But it turned out to have too much magic. Not good, especially if something gets broken after update and you have no idea how to fix it. 
So I started over building [my own react app](https://github.com/apanchenko/antonpanchenko.com). It is clean and under control now. A lot of features yet to do.
