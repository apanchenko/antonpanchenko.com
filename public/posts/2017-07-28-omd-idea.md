Hello! I am making this blog not to learn [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) but
also to improve English writing skills.  
After the work, I had a very pleasant walk across the city center and was going to jump on the
train to my town, when doors shut in front of my nose. I found myself outside the train while part of headphones cord was trapped between impacted door rubbers. I had only a second before the train
goes with the headphones so I grasped and pulled the cord. Unfortunately, doors were stronger than the cord and half left in the train.  
Enjoying evening sky and dreaming about new wireless headphones I thought: instead of forthcoming [brain-computer interface](https://facebook.github.io/react/), they should make a micro speaker implanted into the skull that could translate sound signal right into the head. No more headphones. After all, cardiac pacemakers work fine. No more fucking headphones!
